# Predicting Crop Yield for Kharif Season Using Time-Series Modeling  

## Project Description  

Accurate crop yield prediction is a cornerstone of sustainable agriculture, ensuring optimal resource utilization and food security. This project focuses on analyzing Kharif season crop data and developing a time-series machine learning or deep learning model to predict crop yields for regions with similar characteristics.  

### Objectives:  
1. **Data Analysis:** Conduct exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the relationships between environmental, agricultural, and yield attributes.  
2. **Predictive Modeling:** Build a time-series model to forecast crop yields based on regional and climatic characteristics.  
3. **Decision Support:** Provide actionable insights for farmers, policymakers, and agricultural stakeholders to enhance productivity and sustainability.  

### Dataset:  
The dataset contains information on Kharif season crops, with the following attributes:  
- **Crop Details:** Crop type, crop year, and season.  
- **Regional Information:** State, latitude, and longitude.  
- **Agricultural Inputs:** Area under cultivation, production, fertilizers, and pesticides used.  
- **Environmental Factors:** Annual rainfall, average temperature (min/max/mean), precipitation rate, wind speed, and pressure.  
- **Air Quality Metrics:** Levels of CO, NO, NO2, O3, SO2, PM2.5, PM10, and NH3.  
- **Target Variable:** Yield of the crop.  

### Key Steps:  
1. **Data Preprocessing:**  
   - Handle missing values and outliers.  
   - Normalize features and encode categorical variables.  
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**  
   - Analyze the distribution of crop yields and environmental factors.  
   - Identify trends and correlations using visualizations.  
3. **Model Development:**  
   - Train time-series machine learning or deep learning models (e.g., ARIMA) to predict crop yields.  
   - Evaluate models using metrics such as RMSE and MAE.  
4. **Insights and Recommendations:**  
   - Highlight the impact of climatic and agricultural factors on yield.  
   - Forecast crop yields for regions with similar characteristics.  

### Tools and Technologies:  
- **Programming Language:** Python  
- **Libraries:** Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn 
- **Environment:** Jupyter Notebook

### Results:  
- Built a robust predictive model to forecast crop yields for Kharif season crops.  
- Identified critical factors such as rainfall, temperature, and fertilizer usage influencing crop productivity.  
- Provided valuable insights for improving agricultural planning and decision-making.
